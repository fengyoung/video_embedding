# Video-Embedding

This is Implement of Video Embedding based on ***Tensorflow, Inception-V3 & FCNN(Frames Supported Convolution Neural Network)*** 

Video Embeding can be interpreted as the processing of **Video Features Extraction**. As figure-1, a video consisits of a lots of images (named *frame*). Each frame contants image concept, and these concept can be organized to a matrix in time sequence (we call it **Video-Matrix**) which can be used for representing the content of the video in frame level details. The extraction of Video-Matrix is as the same as image embedding. We choose Inception-v3 to solve it.

However, we don't need the frame details in some video applications, for example, Video-Retrieval, Recommendation etc. So we prepose a new CNN to compress the 2-D Video-Matrix to a 1-D **Video-Vector**.

***figure-1. The Processing of Video Embedding***

The new CNN, which is called **FCNN (Frames Supported Convolution Neural Network)**, contains 6 *f_conv* layers, 1 *densely connect* layer and 1 *softmax* layer. The output of densely connect layer (the last layer before softmax) is the Video-Vector. FCNN is trained by using Weibo-MCN classificated data-set, and it also can be used for video classification.

## 1. Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tensorflow >= 1.0
- OpenCV >= 3.2

## 2. Installation

**(1) Install TensorFlow**

See [Installing TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) for instructions on how to install the release binaries or how to build from source.

**(2) Install OpenCV on Python**

You can find the introduction and Download link at [OpenCV-3.2](http://opencv.org/opencv-3-2.html) or other websites. Choose the right version (over version 3.2) to install on your enverimant. 

**(2) Clone the source of video_embedding**

```
git clone https://github.com/fengyoung/video_embedding.git <YOUR REPO PATH>
```

## 3. How to Use

Some resources and testing models are provided, such as:

- [Inception-v3](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1qYjWy4G): Graph file of inception-v3. 
- [FCNN model](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1o8uko22): trained FCNN model based on Weibo-MCN Classification data set. 
- [2 short videos](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1qYDc8pQ): short videos for testing of features extraction or classification. 
- [Weibo-MCN Video-Mat-Set](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1pK8KFGJ): 60,000+ video-matrices of Weibo-MCN classification data set in format of tfrecord proto. 

### 3.1 Video Features Extraction

There are 2 types of features extraction to get **Video-Matrix** & **Video-Vector** respectively: 

(1) The Video-Matrix could be extracted from a video file by using ***video2mat.py*** like: 
```
cd <THIS REPO>
python video2mat.py --graph_file <inception-v3 graph file> --input <video file> --output <output video-matrix file>
```
You can get the usage and argumets description using "-h", like: 
```
python video2mat.py -h
```

(2) The Video-Vector could be extracted from a video file by using ***video2vec.py*** like:
```
python video2vec.py --graph_file <inception-v3 graph file> --fcnn_model <FCNN model file> --input_file <video file> --output_file <output video-vector file>
```

(3) The Video-Vector also could be extracted from a Video-Matrix by using ***vmat2vec.py*** like: 
```
python vmat2vec.py --fcnn_model <FCNN model file> --input_file <input VMP file> --output_file <output video-vector file>
```

### 3.2 Video Classification

FCNN could be used for video classification. The example is ***video_classify.py***:
```
python video_classify.py --graph_file <inception-v3 graph file> --fcnn_model <FCNN model file> --input_file <video file>
```
Then predicted probilities and corresponding classes would be printed on the screen. Each class is encode to a ingeter ID, you can find the mapping between IDs and classes in [Weibo CateID mapping](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1dE1D1Pf) 

### 3.3 FCNN Training

You can construct your own classification video data set, extract Video-Matrices and generate VMP files in tfrecord proto as your own training set. Or you can use **Weibo-MCN Video-Mat-Set**, which provided before, to train a new FCNN model by using ***train_fcnn.py***. Like: 
```
python train_fcnn.py --vmp_path <VMP_PATH> --naming <NAMING> --model_path <MODEL_PATH> --epoch 100 --batch_size 10
```
Then copy ***\<MODEL_PATH\>/\<NAMEING\>/video_embedding_fcnn.ckpt-done*** as the final FCNN model. 

Arguments of "train_fcnn.py" are as follow:
```
--vmp_path VMP_PATH
  Training VMP data path. Tfrecord proto supported only
--naming NAMING
  The name of this model. Determine the path to save checkpoint and events file.
--model_path MODEL_PATH
  Root path to save checkpoint and events file. The final path would be <model_path>/<naming>
--epoch EPOCH
  Epoch times. Default is 100
--batch_size BATCH_SIZE
  How many samples should be used in one time of model updating. Default is 50
```

## 4. Data Proto

There are two supported types of the Video-Matrix Patterns (VMP): pattern-string & tfrecord. 

Specially, Video-Vector can be regarded as a type of Video-Matrix which contains 1 frame only.

### 4.1 Pattern-String proto

```
mid,labelid0_labelid1_labelid2,height_width,x0_x1_x2_..._xn
mid,labelid2_labelid5,height_width,x0_x1_x2_..._xn
...
```

### 4.2 Tfrecord proto

```
features: {
  feature: {
    key: "mid"
    value: {
      bytes_list: {
        value: [mid string]
      }
    }
  }
  feature: {
    key: "label"
    value: {
      bytes_list: {
        value: ["0,3,7"]    # labelid list string 
      }
    }
  }
  feature: {
    key: "size"
    value: {
      int64_list: {
        value: [v_height, v_width]
      }
    }
  }
  feature: {
    key: "feature"
    value: {
      float_list: {
        value: [(v_height * width) float features]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
